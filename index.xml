      <description> About me I spend most of my time writing code for Bitcoin Core or thinking about Bitcoin. I work at Chaincode Labs in New York, where I have a lot of freedom to work on projects that I think are important or interesting.
Some projects I work on are:
 Bitcoin Core Bitcoin Optech Chaincode&amp;rsquo;s Bitcoin and Lightning Applications residency programs  </description>
