      <description> About me I spend most of my time writing code for Bitcoin Core or thinking about Bitcoin. I work at Chaincode Labs in New York, where I have a lot of freedom to work on projects that I think are important or interesting.
Some projects I work on are:
 Bitcoin Core Bitcoin Optech Chaincode&amp;rsquo;s Bitcoin and Lightning Applications residency programs  </description>

In Summer 2016, I’d been interested in Bitcoin for a little over a year. I’d been slowly becoming more and more enchanted by this strange and wonderful technology, and I’d finally made the step of quitting my job of eight years with the intention of finding a way to make a living by working on Bitcoin. Matt Corallo’s announcement of the first Hacker Residency was very happy timing.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Bitcoin Core Fee Estimation</title>

Why we have fees Space in the Bitcoin blockchain is a limited resource, and given a low enough price, demand for that space will far exceed the supply. If block space is free, people will find all kinds of uses for it — decentralised gambling, uploading an entire copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper, and timestamping individual documents are just a few examples we’ve seen in the past.</description>

      <description>In January of this year, I moved to New York to take a job contributing full time to open source Bitcoin projects. These are some of my experiences in those first few months.
First of all, I recognize that I’m incredibly fortunate. Not only do I have tremendous freedom to work on what I think is important or interesting, I get to sit alongside and work directly with brilliantly talented and motivated people.</description>
